					<p class = "mission-text"> I want to share my wonder and knowledge of the world of coffee. A number of years gigging at coffee shops has left me with an odd trove of knowledge, a passion for quality coffee, and a drive to provide a primer for the coffee curious.

					<h2 class = "bio-head">Who I am</h2>
					<p class = "bio-text"> I hail from upstate NY, where the cows roam, the winters are fierce, and CSAs thrive. At a barista job, I my palate expanding over the course of numerous cuppings, while 'coffee labs' laid a solid foundation of coffee knowledge. Though I'm no longer pulling shots and pouring swans, I still like to pause with my morning coffee, and focus fully on the full coffee experience, from first whiff, to linger aftertaste.

					<h3>Why do people seek out coffee grown at high altitudes?</h3>
					<p class = "featured-question-text"> While I haven't found the hard science to back this up, there's a correlation between the altitude at which coffee is grown and the density and sweetness of the bean. I've seen theories being thrown around about air pressure affecting the growth of the coffee cherries, but the more widely held theory is that high elevations are correlated with cool nights, even at the equatorail latitudes where coffee flourishes. The thinking goes that these cool nights slow the growth of the cherry, allowing them to develop more slowly, and thus creating a more dense coffee bean, packed with more sugar. Again, correlation does not prove causation, but the most sought after coffee tends to grow at high altitudes; Kona coffee is an excpetion to this rule.
